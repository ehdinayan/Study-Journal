# Hey world that's a cool thing and I am a cool man!

``` 
I would like to say The Unix Workbench is quite struggling course
and has several headaches to get to, but otherwise it is a great oportunity
to learn Linux computing with the help of great mentors and other
cool peopple like me.

```
## Now I would like to share a link to a [song](https://soundcloud.com/user-878978370/ladridos-de-amor-edicion)

It was made about two years ago with a neighbor and dedicated to our dogs Pancho and Choco.

## Other thing I can do is share a photo of mine so everyone can see how cool I am

- Damn it! first I should push a photo to github in order to have an url 
to fit in the file XD
